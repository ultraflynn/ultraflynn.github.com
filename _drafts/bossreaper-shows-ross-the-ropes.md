Tagging in Siege of Shanghai with Ricky  
Ricky is proud of his platoon and just can't help tagging it's name all other the place. Let's see how he gets on.

Ultraflynn on a kill-streak. Doesn't happen often.  
It's a rare event when I go on a kill-streak so I thought I'd publish it in case anyone was in any doubt that beast-mode really was engaged.

Crappy aiming, or crappy hit detection. You decide.  
I know my aim is crappy. I know I miss a lot. But I'm not convinced the hit detection is doing this game justice.

Observational Awareness 101  
It's important to know what is occurring on the battlefield to avoid getting run over my huge slow moving ships. The pilot in this clips clearly didn't get that memo.

Dino button location on Rogue Transmission  
There are two buttons on Rogue Transmission that needs to be pressed at the same time to activate the hidden extra on this map. One is near the A flag on top of the crane (near the winch) and the other is near the E flag and a little hard to find. This video shows where that second button is.

Slowing down the mobile rocket launcher  
Mobile rocket launchers are too fast and to help the other side the commander in this clip helpfully drops a resupply crate on top of it to slow it down. I've seen a resupply crate land on a soldier and kill him before but I've never seen it land on the mobile rocket launcher.
