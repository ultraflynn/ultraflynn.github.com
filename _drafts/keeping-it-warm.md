synopsis: Keeping it warm
---
Picture the scene, it's a lovely sunny day and you've been running for hours. You arrive at an aid station feeling hot and thirsty, someone gives you an ice cold cup of your favourite race drink. Awesome. Just what you needed.

Right, now let's change one parameter, you're not running on a sunny day, actually it's -5, the wind is blasting and you are struggling to keep warm. That freezing cold drink is suddenly the worse thing in the world. You can't drink something that will make you even colder. So you avoid drinking much and now you are flirting with dehydration.

This is not a good situation to get into, what you really need is a constant supply of warm drink. How do you do that though? You could pre- heat it but before long it would be cold again. You can't bring a heater along can you?!

Actually it turns out that you can. I shall explain.
