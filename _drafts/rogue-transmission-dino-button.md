synopsis: Rogue Transmission Dino button location
---
In case you were wondering where the location of the 2nd dino button is on Rogue Transmission this video will show you.

The 1st button is up near A flag on top of a crane. You have to use a quad bike to jump up on top of the crane and it's near the winch.
