synopsis: The case that I'm modifying dates from 2007 and was built by Coolermaster. I believe it's an Elite case of some kind and I've done a lot of research to determine exactly what type but I can't identify it. Before I start on the build I thought I'd photograph the initial state.

[picture of all the parts I currently have for case]

This case dates from 2007 when I bought it new. Originally it housed a Q6600 gaming rig which at the time rocked. Time moved on though and I wasn't much into keeping it upgraded so I stopped being able to play the latest games on it. I still used it though for internet browsing and work so it never really sat idle.

[close up of the fan modifications]

A few years I went through the process of trying to get the PC as quiet as possible and one of the things I did was to remove the fan grills. I can't say that it really helped much to reduce noise but it must have allowed better airflow into and out of the case. The edges of this work are ok but not great. Part of the case mods will be to make this look like it left the factory with no grills.

[watercooling holes]

The case has two watercooling holes which gives me the option (without having to make more holes) of routing pipes outside of the case to get to an external res.

[drive mounting areas]

The enclosure has room for the following drives:

* 4x 5.25 inch front
* 2x 3.5 inch front
* 4x 3.5 inch internal

This may change though because I'm considering removing the bottom drive bay to make room for a radiator.
