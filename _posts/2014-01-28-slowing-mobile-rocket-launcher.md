title: Slowing down the mobile rocket launcher
categories: [gaming]
tags: [YouTube, BF4]
synopsis: Mobile rocket launchers are too fast and to help the other side the commander in this clip helpfully drops a resupply crate on top of it to slow it down. I've seen a resupply crate land on a soldier and kill him before but I've never seen it land on the mobile rocket launcher.
