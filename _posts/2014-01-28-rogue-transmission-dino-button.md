title: Dino button location on Rogue Transmission
categories: [gaming]
tags: [YouTube, BF4]
synopsis: There are two buttons on Rogue Transmission that needs to be pressed at the same time to activate the hidden extra on this map. One is near the A flag on top of the crane (near the winch) and the other is near the E flag and a little hard to find. This video shows where that second button is.
