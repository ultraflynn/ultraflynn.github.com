title: Introduction to my PC build

synopsis: I'm in the planning stages of building a PC. This wont be just a collection of parts, for the first time I'm going to do some case modding and put a water cooling loop in.

I've built some PCs before but those projects have really been a case of buying the right parts and bolting them together. My current build is going to be a little different though.

The parts going into this build are all recycled from old PCs so don't expect the latest and greatest hardware. The focus of the project is the case mods. Here's the basic parts going into the build:

* Intel i5-760
* Asus Pxxx Deluxe
* Corsair CX600M PSU
* 4GB Corsair EMS memory

Here's the general plan:

#### Case Mods
The major work on this build will be based around modding the case. At the very least the case will get some additional fans and an acrylic side panel. I'm probably going to do more though and pick a theme for the case. Not sure at the moment what that would be but as I'm no artist it would have to be something which has a large body of work that I can use. I'm not using this but for example I saw a build recently which was based on Half Life 3. The builder used the graphic and artistic design from the game to produce a case that was in keeping with that game. I'm going to try and pick something along the same lines.

#### Custom Paint
Once the case mods are completed I'm going to fully disassemble the case and respray inside and out. At the moment I don't know what colour but that decision will be base on the theme that I pick. I'll have to wait until later on in the year when the weather improves though, as it's too cold for painting currently.

#### Watercooling
One of the critical components of the build is the addition of a CPU watercooling loop. I may build in enough capacity to cool a CPU or 2 also but in this initial iteration only the CPU is required. This isn't a gaming PC and the current GPU isn't worth cooling. I havn't decided on whether to go for a bayres or tubular reservoir yet. That decision will have to wait until I've decided on a theme.

Another thing I'm keen to put in is hard acrylic pipework. I don't like tubes very much and I like the clean lines of hard pipes. I might avoid the current trend of 90 degree bends and see whether I can come up with something more creative.

#### Lighting
I'm going to build some custom lighting for the case. I want to create this myself rather than just buying something off the shelf. That's going to mean lots of soldering, heat sleeving and wiring.

#### Sleeving
All cables within the case are going to be sleeved and where possible custom made to exactly fit the purpose. That's going to mean I'll be learning sleeving, crimping and heat shrinking.

#### Dust Management
A feature I'm going to pay close attention to is the management of dust within the case. Filters are going to be used throughout to ensure that the components inside stay dust free. I want to be able to run the PC for long periods of time so it's important to plan for keeping on top of the dust accumilation.
